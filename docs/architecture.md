# Architecture

Three things in intern are easy to get wrong in ways that do not announce
themselves: the bot's panel state, how a bare address finds its chain, and how the
CLI and the bot stay in agreement. This document is about those three.

---

## 1. The panel state machine

### One message per chat

A bot that answers each command with a new message buries the thing you are looking
at under the history of how you got there. So each chat owns exactly **one** panel
message. Its id lives on the session:

```ts
interface Session {
  chatId: number;
  panelId: number | null;      // the message every view edits
  view: View;                  // what is currently drawn
  draft: Draft;                // what is being assembled
  controller?: AbortController;
  gate: EditGate;              // paces edits to this panel
  autoTimer?: NodeJS.Timeout;
  stageSignature?: string;     // to notice a stage transition
}
```

Every state change funnels through one method:

```ts
private async paint(session, text, buttons) {
  session.gate.record(this.now());
  if (session.panelId !== null) {
    try { await client.editMessage(chatId, panelId, text, {buttons}); return; }
    catch { session.panelId = null; }   // deleted or too old — fall through
  }
  const sent = await client.sendMessage(chatId, text, {buttons});
  session.panelId = sent.message_id;
}
```

The fallback matters. Users delete messages, and Telegram refuses edits on messages
past a certain age. A bot that then refuses to draw anything looks broken, so a
failed edit silently becomes a new panel and the session adopts it.

### The views

```
                   ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
                   │                menu                  │◀──── /start
                   └──┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┘

                      ▼        ▼        ▼        ▼
                 awaitTarget  check   stages  wallets/status
                      │      (live)   (live)     (live)
                      ▼
                 awaitChain ──── only when detection is ambiguous
                      ▼
                awaitQuantity
                      ▼
                  awaitTime
                      ▼
                   confirm  ◀──── nothing has touched a key yet
                      │
                   ✅ Send
                      ▼
                   running  ──── holds the global run lock
```

`View` is a closed union (`menu`, `awaitTarget`, `awaitChain`, `awaitQuantity`,
`awaitTime`, `confirm`, `running`, `check`, `stages`, `wallets`, `status`), and the
`Draft` accumulates alongside it. A slash command always wins over whatever the
state machine was expecting, so a half-finished setup can never trap a chat —
`/cancel` and `/start` are reachable from every view.

### Callbacks are a closed vocabulary

Callback data is attacker-supplied in the same sense message text is: the client
echoes back whatever it was given, and a modified client can send anything. So
`PANEL_ACTIONS` is a fixed set, and `parseCallback` returns `null` for anything
outside it rather than defaulting:

```ts
export function parseCallback(data: string | undefined): ParsedCallback | null {
  if (!data) return null;
  const sep = data.indexOf(":");
  const rawAction = sep === -1 ? data : data.slice(0, sep);
  if (!isPanelAction(rawAction)) return null;
  return { action: rawAction, value: sep === -1 ? "" : data.slice(sep + 1) };
}
```

`null` produces a visible *"That button is no longer valid — reopen the panel with
/start"*, not a silent no-op. An unrecognised action almost always means a stale
keyboard from a previous deployment, and doing nothing there is indistinguishable
from a bot that has hung.

Values are range-checked at the point of use, never trusted because we authored the
button: `qty:5` is validated with `Number.isInteger(n) && n >= 1 && n <= 1000`.

### Order of operations on a press

**Authorize → acknowledge → act.** The acknowledgement comes before the work
because Telegram spins the client's button for about thirty seconds without one, and
preparing a run takes several seconds — long enough for a user to conclude nothing
happened and press again.

```ts
if (!chat || !this.authorized(query.from.id, chat)) {
  await client.answerCallback(query.id, "Not authorized to use this bot.", true);
  return;
}
const parsed = parseCallback(query.data);
if (!parsed) { /* stale-button alert */ return; }
if (parsed.action !== "refresh") await client.answerCallback(query.id);
await this.dispatchAction(session, parsed.action, parsed.value, query.id);
```

Refresh answers its own callback, because it is the one action that may need to
report a debounce instead of a result.

### Authorization, identically on both paths

```ts
private authorized(userId: number | undefined, chat: {id: number; type: string}): boolean {
  if (userId === undefined) return false;
  if (!this.opts.allowedIds.includes(userId)) return false;
  if (chat.type !== "private" && !this.opts.allowedIds.includes(chat.id)) return false;
  return true;
}
```

The same function runs on `message.from.id` and on `callback_query.from.id`. This is
the single easiest thing to get wrong in a bot like this: checking messages and
forgetting that a callback query carries its own `from`. A panel sitting in a group
is visible to every member, so "who pressed the button" is exactly as open a
question as "who typed the command" — and a panel left open in a group would
otherwise be a mint button for the whole room. `tests/botauth.test.ts` drives both
paths through the real `handleUpdate` to hold that in place.

Note the asymmetry in the response: an unsolicited **message** is ignored in silence
(replying confirms the token is live and worth probing), while an unauthorized
**press** is refused out loud (the presser can already see the panel, so there is
nothing to conceal, and silence reads as a broken button).

### Two locks, deliberately different

```ts
private running: number | null = null;   // chatId holding the lock, or null
```

One mint run at a time **globally**, not per chat: the wallets come from a single
`.env`, and two concurrent runs would sign different transactions with the same
nonces. Only `fire()` takes this lock.

Read-only panels — `check`, `stages`, `wallets`, `status` — never take it. They
read; they cannot spend. Holding the run lock to display a countdown would mean one
person watching a drop blocks everyone else from minting, which is backwards.

### Live panels and edit pacing

Telegram allows roughly one edit per second per chat. A 🔄 Refresh button and a 20s
auto loop can exceed that trivially — two taps in a second, or a tap landing on the
same tick as the timer. `EditGate` decides this in one place:

```ts
allows(source: "manual" | "auto", nowMs: number): boolean {
  const gap = source === "manual" ? this.debounceMs : this.minGapMs;   // 3000 / 1000
  return nowMs - this.lastEditMs >= gap;
}
```

Two limits protecting two different things. The **3s manual debounce** protects the
user from their own repeat taps: a refresh re-reads stages, supply, gas and
balances, and doing that five times because someone tapped five times burns RPC
quota to return identical numbers. The **1s hard gap** protects the connection from
a 429 and applies to every edit regardless of origin.

`record()` is called only when an edit actually goes out, so a refused refresh does
not push the next allowed one further away — otherwise repeat tapping would starve
the panel indefinitely. Time is passed in rather than read internally, which is why
`tests/panel.test.ts` can pin all of this down without sleeping.

Auto-refresh stops on three conditions: the user toggles it, a mint starts, or a
stage transitions. The last one is detected by comparing a signature across renders:

```ts
export function stageSignature(run: Pick<PreparedRun, "stages">): string {
  return run.stages.rows.map((r) => `${r.kind}:${r.label}:${r.status}`).join("|");
}
```

When that string changes, something crossed a boundary — a stage opened or closed —
and the panel stops auto-refreshing rather than quietly continuing to tick past the
moment the user was waiting for.

### Time

Nothing in the panel path calls `Date.now()`. `SessionManager.now()` reads a
`CorrectedClock` measured against the network at startup, and every countdown and
`updated HH:MM:SS` footer goes through it. The offset is the *machine's* clock
error, which is chain-independent, so one startup sync serves every panel; an actual
mint re-syncs inside the engine against the chain it fires on.

---

## 2. Chain auto-detection

### The problem

An OpenSea link carries its chain. A slug can be looked up. A bare `0x` address
carries nothing — and requiring `--chain` for it is a real failure mode, not a minor
inconvenience: the default gets used, the address has no code on that chain, and the
drop reads as "not configured" or the mint reverts. Both look like a problem with
the collection rather than a problem with the flag.

### The probe

`eth_getCode` on every configured chain, concurrently. It is the right question: one
cheap read, no ABI needed, and a non-empty answer proves *something* is deployed
there. It does not prove the thing is a SeaDrop collection — `buildMintPlan` decides
that afterwards, on the chain this picked.

Concurrent across chains because they are independent and the latency is entirely
network-bound; serially this would be eight round trips on the interactive path
while someone waits. Within a chain, endpoints are tried in order and the first
usable answer wins — code presence is not a matter of opinion between endpoints.
Send-only sequencers are skipped: they reject reads, so probing them adds a
guaranteed-failed request per chain and no information.

### The decision, isolated and pure

```ts
export function classifyProbes(probes: ChainProbe[]): Detection {
  const withCode = probes.filter((p) => p.hasCode);
  if (withCode.length === 1) return {kind: "single", chainKey: withCode[0]!.chainKey, probes};
  if (withCode.length > 1)  return {kind: "ambiguous", candidates: withCode.map(p => p.chainKey), probes};
  return {kind: "none", probes};
}
```

This is separated from the I/O above it because it is the part that must not be
wrong, and a bug here is silent. **Collapsing "ambiguous" into "single" does not
throw and does not warn — it mints on an arbitrary chain.** A CREATE2-deployed
collection has the same address on every chain it was deployed to, so the wrong pick
is a real transaction on a real network with nothing to show for it.

The three outcomes stay three outcomes:

- **single** → use it, no question asked.
- **ambiguous** → **ask**. Never resolved by heuristic. Not by code size, not by
  latency, not by "ethereum is probably right" — none of those have anything to do
  with which deployment the user meant.
- **none** → say so, and list which chains were probed and which never answered. A
  failed probe is "unknown", never "no code there"; treating it as a negative is how
  the one chain that did answer wins by default.

### Plugging into both renderers

The core must not know which renderer is attached, so the ambiguous case is raised
rather than resolved. `prepareRun` throws `AmbiguousChainError` carrying the
candidates, and each renderer answers it in its own idiom.

**CLI** — a numbered prompt, or a clear error when there is no TTY to prompt on:

```ts
async function prepareResolvingChain(opts: PrepareOptions): Promise<PreparedRun> {
  try {
    return await prepareRun(opts);
  } catch (err) {
    if (!(err instanceof AmbiguousChainError)) throw err;
    const candidates = orderCandidates(err.candidates);
    if (!process.stdin.isTTY) throw new Error(/* names the chains, suggests --chain */);
    const chainKey = await askChoice("Which chain did you mean?", candidates);
    return prepareRun({ ...opts, chainKey });
  }
}
```

All four CLI commands (`check`, `watch`, `mint`, `allowlist`) route through this one
function, so none of them can acquire a different chain-resolution policy later.

**Bot** — the same information as an inline keyboard. The session moves to
`awaitChain`, `renderChainPicker` restates the address (the panel can arrive a while
after it was typed, and picking a chain for the wrong address is not recoverable
once the mint fires), and `chainKeyboard` emits `chain:<key>` buttons.

Candidate ordering is registry order in both — deliberately not sorted by code size
or latency. Neither has anything to do with the answer, and a list that reorders
itself between renders is a list people misclick.

### Caching

Keyed by lowercased address. A contract's code cannot leave a chain, so the answer
cannot change while the process runs. Without this, a panel auto-refreshing every
20s would re-probe eight chains on every tick.

---

## 3. Shared-core parity

The requirement is that the CLI and the bot never drift and never duplicate logic.
That is enforced structurally, not by convention — conventions are what drift.

### The layering

```
              ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │  core/  engine · prepare · seadrop · rpc   │
              │         detect · stages · stagetable       │
              │         clock · timing · wallets           │
              └───────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                              │  events + data, no strings
              ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
              ▼                               ▼
      ┌───────────────┐               ┌───────────────┐
      │  cli/report   │               │  bot/panel    │
      │  padded table │               │  labelled     │
      │  ANSI colour  │               │  Telegram HTML│
      └───────────────┘               └───────────────┘
```

`core/` knows nothing about terminals or Telegram. It emits events and returns data.
Both renderers subscribe to the same `EngineEvent` stream, so a run reports the same
facts in both places by construction: there is one implementation of the mint.

### Where parity actually breaks, and the fix

The engine was never the risk — it is one code path. The risk is **presentation
logic that looks like formatting but is really a decision**: which columns exist,
what a cell says when a value is unknown, what order rows come in. That is exactly
the kind of thing that gets fixed in one renderer and not the other.

So `core/stagetable.ts` owns those decisions and produces plain-string cells:

```ts
export const STAGE_COLUMNS = ["stage","price","window","cap","status","mints left","source"] as const;

export function stageCells(row: StageRow, chain: ChainProfile, fmtTime): StageCells {
  return {
    stage: /* kind, plus the creator's label when it adds something */,
    price: row.priceWei === null ? "—" : formatEth(row.priceWei, chain.nativeSymbol),
    window: formatWindow(row, fmtTime),
    cap: row.perWalletCap > 0 ? String(row.perWalletCap) : "—",
    status: statusText(row),
    mintsLeft: /* "3800 / 5000" or "—" */,
    source: row.source,
  };
}
```

The CLI pads these into a box. The bot escapes them into labelled lines, because
Telegram renders a proportional font and a seven-column table wraps on a phone
regardless. **The two look different and say the same thing** — neither decides what
a column *means*, so `intern check` and 📊 Stages cannot end up disagreeing about a
drop.

The same applies to wording the spec fixes verbatim. `stageSummaryLines` produces
`"Time until start: HH:MM:SS"` and `"Mint left: [X / Total]"` once, for both.

### Source labelling as a correctness property

Every row carries where it came from, and this is not decoration:

- **PUBLIC** is on-chain — price, window and per-wallet cap read from the SeaDrop
  drop struct. Authoritative; it cannot be changed under you.
- **GTD / TEAM / ALLOWLIST / FCFS** live in OpenSea's drop configuration. On-chain
  there is only `mintSigned()`, whose parameters arrive inside a server-signed
  payload at mint time. Before such a stage opens there is no on-chain record of its
  price at all.

A table mixing the two silently invites trusting the wrong half, so `source` is a
column in both renderers and is never dropped to save width. An unknown price prints
`—`, never `0 ETH`: those are different claims, and "free mint" is one people act on.

Where the two disagree about the public stage — a creator who edited the schedule on
OpenSea without reconfiguring the contract — the on-chain row wins, because it is
the one the contract will enforce.

Missing data is stated, not omitted. Without `OPENSEA_API_KEY` the table says which
stages are not shown and why; silently showing only the public stage is how someone
concludes a drop has no allowlist and misses the only stage they were eligible for.
Three distinct situations stay distinct — no key (fixable), a key that returned
nothing (a fact about the drop), a key whose request failed (transient).

### Shared preparation

`core/prepare.ts` is the single setup path: resolve the target, detect the chain,
plan RPCs, build the mint plan, build the stage table. `prepareRun` returns a
`PreparedRun`; `refreshRun` re-reads it for a live panel. Both renderers call the
same two functions, which is why a fix to target resolution or fee-recipient
selection cannot land in one and miss the other.

### What is legitimately not shared

Only the last step: bytes to a terminal versus HTML to Telegram, ANSI colour versus
`<b>` tags, a padded table versus labelled lines, a readline prompt versus an inline
keyboard. Everything upstream of that — what to read, what it means, what to call
it, what order to show it in — has exactly one implementation.
