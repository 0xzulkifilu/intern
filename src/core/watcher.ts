// Waiting for a stage that isn't open yet.
//
// Two sources disagree about when a mint opens, and both matter:
//
//   On-chain `startTime` is what the contract enforces. It is authoritative for
//   whether a transaction reverts, and it is the only thing worth firing against.
//
//   The OpenSea schedule is what the creator published. It can list stages the
//   contract has not been configured for yet, and it changes when the creator
//   edits the drop.
//
// So the on-chain value decides the fire time, and the schedule is re-read while
// waiting — a creator moving the mint an hour later must not leave us firing into
// a stage that no longer exists. Neither source is polled tightly: a stage hours
// away needs one check a minute, and a stage seconds away is already handled by
// the timing module.
