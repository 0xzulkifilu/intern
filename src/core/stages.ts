// Stage intelligence: one table describing every stage of a drop.
//
// A SeaDrop drop has up to five kinds of stage and they do not live in the same
// place, which is the entire difficulty here:
//
//   PUBLIC        lives on-chain, in the SeaDrop public drop struct (v1 singleton
//                 or v2 config-on-token). Price, window, per-wallet cap and fee
//                 recipient are all contract reads. Authoritative and untamperable.
//
//   GTD / TEAM /  live in OpenSea's drop configuration. On-chain there is only
//   ALLOWLIST /   `mintSigned()`, whose parameters arrive inside a server-signed
//   FCFS          payload at mint time — so before the stage opens there is no
//                 on-chain record of its price or window at all.
//
// That asymmetry is not a detail to paper over. An on-chain price cannot be
// changed under you; an API price is whatever the server said this second. So
// every row carries its `source`, and the renderers print it. A table that mixed
// the two silently would be a table that invites trusting the wrong half.
//
// When there is no API key, the non-public stages are not omitted — their absence
// is stated. Silently showing only the public stage is how someone concludes a
// drop has no allowlist and misses the only stage they were eligible for.
//
// All time arithmetic takes `nowMs` as an argument. Callers pass corrected time
// from src/core/clock; nothing here reads Date.now(), because the countdown in a
// panel and the instant the engine fires at must come from the same clock.
